Hack Club Bank is a project I’m part of building providing a toolkit for organizing and running projects and events. Its recently moved to a new office in Vermont and I’m building an interactive sign for it. The goal is to create something that provides basic branding but also goes further by being digitally connected to the platform and community at large. One concept I’m exploring is a translucent sign with RGB lighting that gradually changes based on actions on the platform like donations, card transactions, new organizations, and others; somewhat inspired by GitHub profile charts. I’ll be implementing the NuVu process by finding precedents and iterating on the design with prototypes to reach a final design and product.
